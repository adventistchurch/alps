# GETTING STARTED

## WELCOME TO THE ADVENTIST LIVING PATTERN SYSTEM Library (ALPS Library)

We are glad you found ALPS Library. Take a look around, and see what you think. There is lots to explore. You can find the code on [GitHub page](https://github.com/adventistchurch/alps/),

The Adventist Living Pattern System (ALPS) Library is a set of design patterns created by the Seventh-day Adventist Church for use
around the world by Adventist churches, schools, and organizational units. The purpose of ALPS is to make it easy for our church
to create good looking sites that promote the brand of the church, while allowing for individuality and customization of each site.

As you browse through the pages of this site, you will see examples of patterns for different types of pages.
From home pages to channel pages, to basic pages, ALPS is designed to be beautiful, fast and flexible,
while maintaining a consistent brand across the sites that use it.

Take a look for yourself!
