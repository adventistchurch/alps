### KEY

The visual explanations of the guidelines across the site use the above three symbols to note acceptable applications of the system.

The green checkmark (✓) notes acceptable and preferred applications.
You can reliably use applications with the green checkmark across many different contexts without needing to worry much about visual coherence.

The yellow exclamation point (!) notes applications that are acceptable but not preferred.
When using these applications, you should be very careful to note how other visual elements interact with the specific element.

The red (X) notes unacceptable applications of the system.
While this visual system isn’t something to be enforced, those applications noted with the X could either cause a fragmentation of the identity or simply be poorly designed.
