## Seventh Day Adventist Pattern Lab

## Overview
This repository contains the front-end code for the Seventh Day Adventist project. [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io/) is the tool used for pattern template building and pattern library compilation.

### Getting Started

- Install node globally via the command line
- run `npm install` (may need to be run as `sudo`)
- run `grunt`
- get mamp working and point toward the patternlab/public folder

This creates all patterns, the styleguide, and the pattern lab site as well as a local server for development.

## Project Standards

### Front-End General Best Practices
1. Separation of presentation, content, and behavior.
2. Markup should be well-formed, semantically correct, and generally valid (if possible).
3. Javascript should progressively enhance the experience.
4. Always keep performance at top of mind when coding.

### CSS Coding Standards
The CSS in this project follows [Harry Robert's](http://csswizardry.com/) [itcss](http://itcss.io/) architecture. [CSS/SCSS Coding Best Practices](http://cssguidelin.es/) should be the referenced standards guide when writing sane, manageable, scalable CSS.

### Git Commit Messages
All commit messages should abide by the following criteria:

* Begin with a one line summary. It should be short (50 chars or less).
* This should be followed by a longer description if necessary.
* The first two items should be separated by an empty line.
* All lines should be wrapped at approximately 72 characters.
* Reference an issue in your commits whenever possible. Use the [Github standard](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/) ```gh-34``` for ticket ```#34```.
* If you forget to reference the issue in your commit, and the commit has already been pushed, reference the commit hash in a comment on the ticket.

### Troubleshooting Installs

Make sure you are running your terminal/command line session as administrator. This could mean `sudo`, or opening the window with a right-click option.

## About Pattern Lab
- [Pattern Lab Website](http://patternlab.io/)
- [About Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io/about.html)
- [Documentation](http://patternlab.io/docs/index.html)
- [Demo](http://demo.patternlab.io/)

The PHP version of Pattern Lab is, at its core, a static site generator. It combines platform-agnostic assets, like the [Mustache](http://mustache.github.io/)-based patterns and the JavaScript-based viewer, with a PHP-based "builder" that transforms and dynamically builds the Pattern Lab site. By making it a static site generator, Pattern Lab strongly separates patterns, data, and presentation from build logic.

## Demo

You can play with a demo of the front-end of Pattern Lab at [demo.patternlab.io](http://demo.patternlab.io).

## Working with Patterns

Patterns are the core element of Pattern Lab. Understanding how they work is the key to getting the most out of the system. Patterns use [Mustache](http://mustache.github.io/) so please read [Mustache's docs](http://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html) as well.

## Creating & Working With Dynamic Data for a Pattern

The PHP version of Pattern Lab utilizes Mustache as the template language for patterns. In addition to allowing for the [inclusion of one pattern within another](http://patternlab.io/docs/pattern-including.html) it also gives pattern developers the ability to include variables. This means that attributes like image sources can be centralized in one file for easy modification across one or more patterns. The PHP version of Pattern Lab uses a JSON file, `source/_data/data.json`, to centralize many of these attributes.

## Using Pattern Lab's Advanced Features

By default, the Pattern Lab assets can be manually generated and the Pattern Lab site manually refreshed but who wants to waste time doing that? Here are some ways that Pattern Lab can make your development workflow a little smoother:
